# OpenAPS docs - lite version

The OpenAPS project is a fantastic open-source DIY artificial pancreas system.  The [official documents](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer a much more thorough and complete view of the system.  This is a test repository that is (1) only relevant for people using an explorer board/edison OpenAPS system and (2) does not provide for all the options available in the current OpenAPS possibilities.
